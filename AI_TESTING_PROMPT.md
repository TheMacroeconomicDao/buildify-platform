# ðŸ¤– AI-Powered Testing Prompt for Buildify Platform

## PROMPT FOR AI ASSISTANT

```
You are a Senior QA Engineer and Test Architect specializing in comprehensive software testing. 
Your task is to perform a complete testing audit of the Buildify Platform - an enterprise-grade 
marketplace for construction services.

## PROJECT CONTEXT

**Platform:** Buildify - Construction Services Marketplace
**Architecture:** Monorepo (Backend API + Mobile App)
**Repository:** https://github.com/TheMacroeconomicDao/buildify-platform

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Laravel 11 (PHP 8.2), PostgreSQL 15, Redis 7
- Mobile: React Native 0.75.3 (iOS & Android)
- Infrastructure: Docker Compose, Nginx, Soketi WebSocket
- Integrations: Stripe, OpenAI GPT-4, Firebase FCM

**Scale:**
- 350+ API endpoints
- 46+ database models
- 47+ mobile screens
- 60+ UI components
- 4 user types (Customer, Executor, Mediator, Admin)

## YOUR MISSION

Perform comprehensive testing to identify ALL bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance 
issues across the entire platform. Current test coverage is critically low (<20% backend, 
<5% mobile), making this a HIGH PRIORITY task.

## TESTING PHASES

### PHASE 1: ANALYSIS & PLANNING (Day 1-2)

1. **Codebase Analysis:**
   - Review backend code structure (Models, Services, Controllers)
   - Review mobile code structure (Components, Screens, Hooks, Redux)
   - Identify critical business logic
   - Map all API endpoints
   - Document user flows

2. **Test Strategy:**
   - Prioritize high-risk areas (payments, auth, order management)
   - Define test coverage targets (70%+ overall)
   - Create test execution plan
   - Set up test environment

**Deliverable:** Testing strategy document with prioritized test plan

### PHASE 2: UNIT TESTING (Day 3-12)

**Backend Unit Tests (Day 3-8):**

Test ALL service classes with 80%+ coverage:

1. **ReferralService** - Critical for revenue
   ```
   Test Cases:
   - createReferralCode() - generates unique 8-char code
   - processReferralRegistration() - links referrer & referred
   - processCashback() - calculates 10% correctly
   - validateCode() - validates active codes only
   - useReferralBalance() - deducts balance for subscriptions
   - getReferralStats() - returns accurate statistics
   
   Edge Cases:
   - Self-referral attempts (should fail)
   - Inactive referral codes (should reject)
   - Duplicate code usage (should prevent)
   - Cashback on $0 deposit (should skip)
   - Negative balance usage (should reject)
   - Circular referrals (Aâ†’Bâ†’A)
   ```

2. **WalletService** - Critical for payments
   ```
   Test Cases:
   - deposit() - adds funds correctly
   - charge() - deducts funds with balance check
   - hasBalance() - accurate balance checking
   - holdFunds() - escrow functionality
   - releaseFunds() - release after order completion
   - refundFunds() - refund on cancellation
   
   Edge Cases:
   - Concurrent transactions (race conditions)
   - Negative amounts (should reject)
   - Balance exactly $0 (edge case)
   - Multiple deposits same time (consistency)
   - Charge more than balance (should fail)
   - Double charge prevention
   ```

3. **SubscriptionService** - Critical for business model
   ```
   Test Cases:
   - activateSubscription() - sets all fields correctly
   - cancelSubscription() - handles cancellation
   - checkExpiration() - detects expired subscriptions
   - switchToNextTariff() - automatic tier switching
   - canCreateOrder() - enforces order limits
   - canSendContact() - enforces contact limits
   
   Edge Cases:
   - Subscription expires mid-operation
   - Upgrade/downgrade edge cases
   - Limit exactly at maximum
   - Expired but not yet switched
   - Multiple subscriptions conflict
   ```

4. **MediatorService** - Unique business logic
   ```
   Test Cases:
   - calculateCommission() - all 3 methods (%, fixed, agreed)
   - assignMediatorToOrder() - assignment logic
   - moveToNextStep() - 3-step workflow
   - completeOrderSuccessfully() - finalization
   - canTakeOrder() - eligibility check
   
   Edge Cases:
   - Commission calculation priority
   - Order already has mediator
   - Skip step attempts
   - Incomplete step data
   - Concurrent mediator assignments
   ```

**Mobile Unit Tests (Day 9-12):**

Test ALL custom hooks with 80%+ coverage:

1. **useAuth Hook:**
   ```
   - login() - handles success/failure
   - logout() - clears auth state
   - register() - multi-step process
   - refreshToken() - token refresh logic
   - checkAuthStatus() - verifies token validity
   ```

2. **useOrders Hook:**
   ```
   - fetchOrders() - loads orders with filters
   - createOrder() - creates with validation
   - updateOrder() - updates correctly
   - cancelOrder() - handles cancellation
   - completeOrder() - mutual completion
   ```

3. **useSubscription Hook:**
   ```
   - fetchTariffs() - loads all tiers
   - purchaseSubscription() - Stripe flow
   - cancelSubscription() - cancels correctly
   - checkLimits() - enforces limits
   ```

4. **Redux Reducers:**
   ```
   Test ALL actions and state changes:
   - authReducer - all auth actions
   - ordersReducer - all order actions
   - subscriptionReducer - all subscription actions
   - walletReducer - all wallet actions
   - notificationsReducer - all notification actions
   ```

**Deliverable:** 
- 200+ unit tests written
- Coverage reports (>70%)
- Bug list from unit testing

### PHASE 3: INTEGRATION TESTING (Day 13-18)
